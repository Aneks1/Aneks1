# Amex

Hi, I'm Amex. I don't really know what to write here.
I will just say that I like Geometry Dash and I make stupid things.

Go to see my repositories to see my stupid things.

I'm working on a Discord Bot called n3x.

I like TypeScript, it is cool.

I really want to make some kind of "hacks" or "mods" for Geometry Dash.

If you are asking why I make stupid things, it's because I don't have ideas.
I always try to make something kind of fun.

Im currently learning [SPWN](https://github.com/Spu7Nix/SPWN-language), it's cool.
I'm trying to make a little game inside GD and I really need some help.

If you want to contact me, send me a Discord DM (`Amex#3159`) or join my Discord [Server](https://discord.gg/uBjtHZWxvA)

I think I will add more things to this README in the future.
cya.
